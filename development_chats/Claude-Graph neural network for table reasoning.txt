Okay, look at this current implementation of table2graph that I have. The central intuition is using a graph to model a table, embedding the nodes and passing it through a GNN such that each node becomes neighbourhood aware. The training job is edge label prediction. For training supervision, I have the class relationship generator that calculates relationships between edges using the features I have selected, and each each relationship interval combination maps to a specific label in an ontology dict that I maintain. The input to my GNN is a representative sample of columns that acts as nodes, and using the training signal I want my GNN to start predicting the correct edge labels. I want to use the output of this GNN for table reasnoning tasks that LLMs will do, so I want these edge predictions to mean something worthwhile. Currently I am calculating 5 features for every column combination however the interval combinations are created for only three features along with dtype, which gives me 18 label combinations that I can map to. First, start by evaluating the state of code and present me what you understand from this approach.

Thought process: Dissected graph-based table reasoning with nuanced edge labeling strategy.

This is a fascinating implementation of a table-to-graph conversion pipeline for improving table reasoning tasks with LLMs. Let me analyze the architecture and approach systematically:

## Core Architecture Understanding:

1. **High-Level Goal**: Convert tabular data into a graph representation where:
   - Nodes = Table columns
   - Edges = Relationships between columns
   - Edge labels = Semantic relationship types (18 classes)
   - Purpose: Enable LLMs to better understand table structure through graph-aware representations

2. **Key Components**:

### Data Processing Layer:
- `DataProcessor`: Handles various file formats, validates data, truncates, and preprocesses
- `ColumnStatsExtractor`: Extracts statistical features from columns (numeric stats, string stats)
- `ColumnContentExtractor`: Creates comprehensive samples from columns using a sophisticated sampling strategy (nulls, extremes, frequent values, random samples)

### Relationship Generation:
- `RelationshipGenerator`: Computes 5 edge features between column pairs:
  1. `name_similarity`: Cosine similarity between column names (char n-grams)
  2. `value_similarity`: Cosine similarity between column values (normalized for numeric, frequency-based for categorical)
  3. `jaccard_overlap`: Sampled Jaccard similarity between unique values
  4. `cardinality_similarity`: Ratio of unique value counts
  5. `dtype_similarity`: Type compatibility score

- `SemanticLabelGenerator`: Maps feature combinations to 18 semantic labels
  - Only uses 3 features for labeling: `value_similarity` (cosine), `jaccard_overlap`, `dtype_similarity`
  - Creates intervals (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) for continuous features
  - Generates labels like "HIGH_COS_HIGH_JAC_NUM" → "LINEAR_NUMERICAL_DEPENDENCE_WITH_SHARED_VALUES"

### Feature Embedding:
- Two tokenizers implemented:
  1. `FeatureTokenizer`: Uses HuggingFace models for embeddings
  2. `LightweightFeatureTokenizer`: Uses sentence transformers + TF-IDF + engineered features (currently used)

### Graph Construction:
The pipeline introduces two critical modes for graph building. In training mode, it generates edges with ground truth labels derived from the RelationshipGenerator. During testing, it creates candidate edges for prediction, transforming the data into PyTorch Geometric Data objects. This approach allows for flexible graph representation across different computational scenarios.

The system's innovative approach lies in its multi-dimensional feature extraction and semantic labeling strategy, which goes beyond traditional table-to-graph conversion methods.

### GNN Architecture and Pipeline Strengths:
I'm using a sophisticated 3-layer GNN edge classification model with a custom TableGCN implementation. The architecture leverages concatenated node embeddings for precise 18-class relationship prediction, integrating built-in training and inference capabilities.

The core pipeline manages complex table relationship learning by supporting multi-table training and adaptive relationship prediction. Its design emphasizes flexibility and semantic understanding.

Key architectural strengths include comprehensive column content sampling, multi-faceted relationship feature extraction, and a semantic ontology that enables interpretable relationship classifications. The 3-hop GNN mechanism particularly excels at capturing nuanced, transitive column relationships.

Potential refinement opportunities exist around feature-label alignment, specifically examining how computed features map to final relationship labels.

The current implementation reveals subtle design challenges:
- Semantic label ontology contains potential overlaps and specificity limitations
- Threshold-based edge creation might inadvertently exclude subtle but meaningful connections
- Feature discretization risks losing granular relationship insights
- The edge classification approach lacks advanced mechanisms like attention networks

These observations suggest targeted architectural improvements could enhance the model's relationship inference capabilities.

The graph learning approach innovatively frames table understanding, but current supervision strategies might constrain novel pattern discovery by overly relying on predefined feature engineering techniques.

Practical considerations highlight potential scalability constraints:
- Quadratic complexity in edge generation
- Sampling limitations could miss nuanced relationship patterns
- Imported LLM technologies remain underutilized
- Model definitions lack clear implementation strategy


Looking at your table2graph implementation, I can see an innovative approach to enhancing table reasoning by modeling tables as graphs. Let me break down what I understand:


Core Architecture & Approach


Central Concept


You're transforming tabular data into a graph where:


Nodes = Table columns (embedded using content samples)

Edges = Relationships between columns

Edge Labels = Semantic relationship types (18 classes)

Goal = Train a GNN to predict meaningful edge labels that can enhance LLM table reasoning


Key Pipeline Flow


Column Embedding (ColumnContentExtractor + LightweightFeatureTokenizer):


Creates comprehensive column samples (nulls, statistical extremes, frequent values, random samples)

Embeds using sentence transformers + TF-IDF + engineered metadata features

Relationship Computation (RelationshipGenerator):


Computes 5 features for each column pair:
name_similarity: Column name similarity via char n-grams

value_similarity: Cosine similarity of values (normalized numeric/frequency categorical)

jaccard_overlap: Sampled Jaccard similarity

cardinality_similarity: Unique value ratio

dtype_similarity: Type compatibility

Label Generation (SemanticLabelGenerator):


Maps feature combinations to 18 semantic labels

Critical: Only uses 3 features (value_similarity, jaccard_overlap, dtype_similarity)

Discretizes continuous features into LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH intervals

Creates labels like "HIGH_COS_HIGH_JAC_NUM" → "LINEAR_NUMERICAL_DEPENDENCE_WITH_SHARED_VALUES"

GNN Training (GNNEdgePredictor):


3-layer GNN captures direct + transitive relationships

Edge classification via concatenated node embeddings

Supervised by the generated semantic labels


Strengths I See


Rich column representation through comprehensive sampling strategy

Multi-faceted relationship features capturing different dependency aspects

Semantic interpretability through the ontology mapping

Graph structure enables capturing transitive relationships via 3-hop GNN


Critical Issues & Opportunities


1. Feature Utilization Gap


You compute 5 features but only use 3 for label generation. The name_similarity and cardinality_similarity are computed but relegated to "auxiliary_features" without clear purpose. This is wasted computation and lost signal.


2. Ontology Rigidity


Your 18-label ontology is the heart of semantic emergence (as you noted), but:


It's hardcoded and may not cover all relationship types

Some labels overlap semantically (e.g., "IDENTICAL_OR_REDUNDANT" vs "CATEGORICAL_DERIVATION_OR_ALIAS")

The discretization (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) loses granularity


3. Information Bottleneck


The pipeline goes from:


Rich continuous features (5 dimensions) →

Discretized intervals (3 dimensions × 3 levels) →

18 fixed labels


This creates an information bottleneck that might prevent the GNN from learning richer patterns.


4. Supervision Strategy Limitation


Using computed features to generate "ground truth" labels means the model can only learn what your feature engineering already captures. It cannot discover novel relationship patterns beyond your predefined ontology.


5. Edge Selection Threshold


The composite score threshold (0.4) for edge creation could miss weak but important relationships. The weights seem arbitrary and might need empirical tuning.


Suggestions for Improvement


Rethink the supervision strategy: Consider using actual downstream task performance (table QA accuracy) as supervision, or human-annotated relationship labels

Utilize all features: Either incorporate all 5 features into label generation or pass them as edge attributes to the GNN

Dynamic ontology: Consider learning relationship embeddings instead of fixed categories, or use a hierarchical label structure

Richer GNN architecture: Incorporate edge features directly into message passing, add attention mechanisms

Evaluation framework: Add metrics to measure if predicted relationships actually help LLM table reasoning


The core intuition of using graphs for table understanding is solid, but the current supervision strategy might be limiting the model's potential. The key question is: are these 18 predefined relationship types truly the optimal abstractions for downstream table reasoning tasks?

## Prompt:
04/10/2025, 12:48:17

Yes, that is the followup question I had. Right now my training signal is the overlaps I am calculating, however, I believe this is missing richer and more importantly semantic signals as supervision. I had to choose the current method as a means to get the edges to predict something as the output of a GNN is either nodes or edges, so it is not apparently clear to me how to get the GNN to learn richer patterns. The problem was that with the output of a GNN there is no clear downstream task I could produce that would inform my supervision signals. More importantly, one thing that LLMs do quite frequently is write SQL queries for tables, so I want to think about how to create a training signal that captures this semantic nuance, for example, a way inform myself whether two columns are highly likely to be used together in an SQL query, and will be used for a specific type of SQL query, being able to generate such a trainining signal would allow me engineer my training features and then the edge label dict can be expanded a lot. Finally, since the engineered features are purely statistical, my worry is that it is only capturing these numerical dependencies, which are sort of useless for an LLM, I want logical dependencies. However, again, I am working with a graph, so the output is going to be in the form of a graph as well, the predictions will either have to be nodes or edges, which is what led me to my current approach. I want you to digest all this information and give me a brief outline of the problem as you understand it, once I am satisfied that you understand the anatomy of the problem I will present my followup questions.

## Response:
04/10/2025, 12:48:38

Thought process: Unraveled semantic training signals for graph-based table reasoning.

The user is articulating a fundamental challenge in their table2graph approach. Let me break down the core problem:

1. **Current State**: They're using statistical feature overlaps (cosine similarity, Jaccard, etc.) to generate training labels for edge prediction. This is essentially a self-supervised approach where computed statistics define the "ground truth."

2. **Core Problem**: The statistical features miss semantic/logical relationships that would actually be useful for LLM table reasoning tasks, particularly SQL generation. They want supervision that captures "which columns are likely to be used together in SQL queries" and "what type of SQL operations connect them."

3. **Fundamental Constraint**: They're working with a GNN, which naturally outputs graph structures (node embeddings or edge predictions), not direct answers to downstream tasks. This creates a gap between what the model can output and what would provide meaningful supervision.

4. **The Dilemma**: 
   - They need supervision signals that capture semantic/logical relationships
   - These signals should inform how LLMs reason about tables (especially for SQL)
   - But GNN outputs are limited to graph structures
   - There's no clear downstream task that bridges this gap

5. **Key Insight**: They recognize that statistical dependencies (correlation, overlap) don't necessarily translate to logical dependencies (foreign keys, join conditions, aggregation groups) that LLMs need for table reasoning.

The user wants me to confirm I understand this anatomy before they present follow-up questions. I should be concise and focus on the core tension between available supervision (statistical) vs desired supervision (semantic/logical), and the constraint of GNN output format.


Problem Anatomy as I Understand It


You're facing a fundamental supervision-objective mismatch:


The Core Tension


What you have: Statistical feature overlaps (cosine similarity, Jaccard, etc.) that generate synthetic labels

What you need: Semantic/logical relationships that inform LLM table reasoning (especially SQL generation)

The constraint: GNN outputs are inherently graph-structured (nodes/edges), not task answers


The Deeper Challenge


Your current pipeline essentially learns to predict its own feature engineering - the GNN is trained to recognize patterns that your statistical features already compute. This creates a circular dependency where the model cannot discover relationships beyond what your handcrafted features capture.


The SQL-Specific Gap


You've identified the critical use case: LLMs writing SQL queries need to understand:


Column co-occurrence patterns (Which columns appear together in JOINs, WHERE clauses, GROUP BYs?)

Relationship types (Is this a foreign key? An aggregation dimension? A filter condition?)

Query operation semantics (Will these columns be joined, compared, or aggregated together?)


These logical dependencies are fundamentally different from statistical correlations. Two columns might have zero statistical overlap but be frequently JOINed (e.g., user_id in different tables), while highly correlated columns might never appear together in queries.


The Architecture Constraint


You're boxed in by the GNN's output format - it produces graph structures, but meaningful supervision would come from downstream task performance (SQL accuracy, table QA scores). There's no obvious bridge between "predict this edge label" and "this helps generate correct SQL."


The fundamental question: How do you create training signals that capture semantic/logical relationships when your model architecture constrains you to graph-structured outputs, and your actual goal is improving LLM table reasoning?


Do I have the right understanding of your problem?

## Prompt:
04/10/2025, 13:03:47

Yes, you have a decent understanding of the problem, additionally I want you to consider that discretizing the outputs was a practical choice as getting the edges to output a meaningful semantic stuff like a sentence on what connects two columns is just not feasible, its akin to having a GPT between column nodes, which is clearly overkill. I have to pick out things where the edges can point to (essentially a classification task) and I can build my reasoning behind the labels being classified. Now, I want you to look at how I am generating my training signals, the entire relationshipgenerator class, semanticlabeller class are just there to create these training signals on the fly, the end result being that a graph should just ingest representative column samples as nodes and point me to my created labels.


Now, I want to incorporate semantic understanding of how these columns can be used downstream. This would mean modifying my relationship generator to produce meaningful interpretations by combining any two columns that are useful and that the GNN can use. I can still use my ontology dict and train it on an edge classification task. You have presented good examples with the column cooccurence patterns, relationship types and query operation semantics, however, we can go beyond this as well and think in terms of a data analyst analysing the columns, and produce meaningful semantic signals for column combinations.


I want to keep my core architecture the same, the current architecture allows me to tweak the the features as i want and map them to specific labels, the interpretation of these labels can be maintained in a separate dictionary and can be changed as I wish. So, briefly comment on the viability of changing this architecture, but keep your suggestion to this architecture for now.


So, I want you to present to me ways I can create these 'semantic understanding' training signals within the relationshipgenerator class. I also want to understand how I can create these signals on the fly, as that would mean I rely on computing things to produce the training signal, so the challenge would be to construct semantic signals by effectively combining and transforming what is in front of me (the table columns) to produce something emergent.


Keep your answers to the point, do not start drafting an artifact, I want you to perform careful analysis of the problem as it is quite nuanced and ask me for clarifications if any.

## Response:

Thought process: Pondered semantic signals for column relationships in graph generation

The user wants to keep the core architecture (relationship generator -> semantic labels -> edge classification) but wants to create more meaningful semantic training signals that capture how columns would be used together in downstream tasks like SQL queries or data analysis.

Key constraints:
1. Must keep edge classification approach (discrete labels)
2. Must generate training signals on-the-fly from the table itself
3. Cannot rely on external supervision or labeled data
4. Wants semantic/logical relationships, not just statistical ones

The challenge is: how to infer semantic relationships from the table content alone, without external knowledge or supervision?

Let me think about viable approaches for generating semantic signals within the RelationshipGenerator class...


Architecture Viability


Your architecture is actually well-suited for this - the modular design where RelationshipGenerator → SemanticLabelGenerator → Edge Classification allows you to swap out the relationship computation logic while keeping the GNN training pipeline intact. The discretization into labels is pragmatic and correct.


Creating Semantic Training Signals On-The-Fly


The key challenge: inferring semantic relationships from table content alone, without external supervision. Here are approaches that could work within your RelationshipGenerator:


1. Pattern-Based Semantic Detection


Detect semantic patterns through content analysis:


Hierarchical relationships: Column A has values that are substrings/prefixes of Column B (e.g., category → subcategory)

Temporal dependencies: DateTime columns with correlated timestamps suggest event sequences

ID-Reference patterns: Columns with overlapping unique identifiers suggest foreign key relationships

Aggregation candidates: High-cardinality to low-cardinality mappings (e.g., transaction_id → customer_id)


2. Functional Dependency Analysis


Compute approximate functional dependencies to infer semantic roles:


If Column A → Column B (A determines B), they likely form a lookup relationship

If A ↔ B (mutual dependency), they might be alternative representations

Group columns by their dependency chains to identify dimension hierarchies


3. Value Distribution Semantics


Infer relationships from distribution characteristics:


Range relationships: Numeric columns with subset/superset ranges

Categorical hierarchies: Columns where one has values that partition the other

Derived calculations: Detect if one column could be computed from another (sum, ratio, difference patterns)


Critical Questions for You:


Bootstrap problem: These signals are still computed from statistical properties. How would you differentiate between "semantically meaningful" and "statistically correlated"? For instance, user_age and account_age might correlate but serve different SQL purposes.

Semantic emergence limitation: Without external knowledge (like knowing what "customer_id" means beyond its values), can we truly capture semantic relationships? Or are we limited to structural patterns that hopefully correlate with semantic meaning?

Validation challenge: How would you validate that your generated labels actually capture SQL-relevant relationships without running SQL queries?


Would you consider a hybrid approach where you:


Generate initial signals using enhanced statistical patterns (as above)

Use an LLM to analyze a few sample rows and generate hypotheses about column relationships

Use these LLM-generated hypotheses to create additional training labels


This would still be "on-the-fly" but would inject actual semantic understanding. Is this within scope, or must everything be computed purely from table structure/content?

## Prompt:
04/10/2025, 13:12:47

Okay, the pattern based semantic detection, functional dependency analysis and value distribution semantics are great starting points. I want you to look at my relationship generator and only write brief pointed snippets that would take any two columns and produce this relationship. Second, using an LLM to generate meaning and then using that meaning as a supervision signal, training the GNN to predict that meaning and feeding it back to an LLM seems circular, one approach could be using a composite structure where I calculate the relationship features (ones that I am already calculating and the ones that you suggest) and then use these features along with table context -> feed it to an LLM and ask it to generate a meaningful semantic representation. However, how would I go about creating this training signal, the output of such a task is going to be a sentence that the LLM produces, which destroys compatibility with the discretized label dict architecture. Ideally, I want everything to be mappable to a specific label, how can I map these semantic interpretations to specific labels? For example, say I calculate ID reference pattern similarity, feed it to an LLM with the table context, and produce some sort of output, how does this get mapped well to a label. Right now the labels are perfectly mapped to interval combinations. Again, this is an extremely nuanced problem so I want you to think deeply about it and explain to me your approach.

## Response:
04/10/2025, 13:13:17

Thought process: Devised semantic mapping strategy for discrete label architecture

The user is asking for two things:
1. Brief snippets showing how to implement the semantic detection methods I suggested
2. A deep analysis of how to map LLM-generated semantic interpretations to discrete labels

The core challenge is that they want to maintain their discrete label architecture but also incorporate richer semantic understanding. The circular problem they identified is real - using an LLM to generate meanings that a GNN then learns to predict for an LLM seems redundant.

Let me think through this carefully:

The key insight is that they need a way to:
- Use computed features + LLM interpretation to generate semantic labels
- But these labels need to be discrete and finite, not free-form text
- The labels should be meaningful for SQL/table reasoning tasks

One approach could be:
1. Compute semantic features (pattern detection, functional dependencies, etc.)
2. Feed these features + sample data to an LLM with a CONSTRAINED output format
3. The LLM maps to predefined semantic categories
4. These categories become the training labels

This preserves the discrete label architecture while injecting semantic understanding.


Semantic Feature Computation Snippets


For your RelationshipGenerator, add these methods:


def detect_id_reference_pattern(self, series1, series2):
    # Foreign key detection
    s1_unique, s2_unique = set(series1.dropna()), set(series2.dropna())
    if len(s1_unique) > len(s2_unique):  # s2 might reference s1
        containment = len(s2_unique & s1_unique) / len(s2_unique)
        return containment if len(s1_unique) / len(s2_unique) > 2 else 0
    return 0

def detect_hierarchical_pattern(self, series1, series2):
    # Parent-child relationships (e.g., category->subcategory)
    if not (pd.api.types.is_string_dtype(series1) and pd.api.types.is_string_dtype(series2)):
        return 0
    # Check if values in one column are prefixes/substrings of the other
    sample = series1.dropna().sample(min(100, len(series1)))
    substring_score = sum(any(str(v1) in str(v2) for v2 in series2.dropna().sample(min(50, len(series2)))) 
                          for v1 in sample) / len(sample)
    return substring_score

def detect_functional_dependency(self, series1, series2):
    # Approximates if col1 -> col2
    grouped = pd.DataFrame({'a': series1, 'b': series2}).groupby('a')['b'].nunique()
    dependency_score = (grouped == 1).sum() / len(grouped)
    return dependency_score


The Label Mapping Challenge


The crux of your problem: How to bridge computed features → LLM interpretation → discrete labels without circularity?


Proposed Solution: Template-Based Semantic Labeling


Instead of having the LLM generate free-form text, use it as a semantic classifier that maps to predefined categories:


Define SQL-oriented label categories (expand your ontology):


SQL_SEMANTIC_ONTOLOGY = {
    "PRIMARY_FOREIGN_KEY": "Likely primary-foreign key for JOIN",
    "DIMENSION_HIERARCHY": "Hierarchical dimension for GROUP BY rollup",
    "TEMPORAL_SEQUENCE": "Time-based columns for ORDER BY",
    "MEASURE_DIMENSION": "Measure-dimension pair for aggregation",
    "FILTER_CANDIDATES": "Commonly filtered together in WHERE",
    # ... 30-50 such labels
}

Create a feature vector combining your existing + new semantic features:


features = {
    'id_reference': 0.8,
    'functional_dependency': 0.6,
    'hierarchical': 0.3,
    'cosine_similarity': 0.4,
    # ... all features
}

Use LLM as a rule-based mapper (not generator):
Instead of asking "What's the relationship?", ask:


prompt = f"""
Given these relationship scores between columns '{col1}' and '{col2}':
- ID reference pattern: {features['id_reference']}
- Functional dependency: {features['functional_dependency']}
- Sample values: {sample_values}

Classify into EXACTLY ONE category:
1. PRIMARY_FOREIGN_KEY (if ID reference > 0.7)
2. DIMENSION_HIERARCHY (if hierarchical > 0.5)
3. MEASURE_DIMENSION (if one numeric, one categorical)
...

Output only the category name.
"""


Why This Solves Your Problem:


No circularity: The LLM acts as a sophisticated rule engine, not a meaning generator

Discrete labels: Output is constrained to your predefined ontology

Semantic injection: The LLM uses column names + samples to disambiguate statistical patterns

Maintains architecture: Still maps to your label dict


The Key Insight:


Your features become evidence that the LLM uses to classify into semantic categories. The LLM's role is disambiguation not generation. For example:


High ID reference + column names ending in "_id" → PRIMARY_FOREIGN_KEY

High correlation + one column named "total_*" → DERIVED_CALCULATION


This way, you're using the LLM's semantic understanding to map statistical patterns to SQL-meaningful categories, without requiring it to generate the meaning itself.


Would this approach work for your use case? The critical design decision is defining the SQL-oriented label taxonomy that captures the relationships you care about.

## Prompt:
04/10/2025, 13:35:04

Okay, this is great trajectory. Now I have two focused questions.


SQL writing and as a consequence the SQL ontology dict is one downstream application, can you think of more downstream tasks that have to do with reasoning over tables and their corresponding features that I will have to engineer. Remember, this is informed to help LLMs reason over tables like an experienced data scientist/analyst would, so I want to engineer ontologies that such a person would hold implictly in their minds.

Effective compression of data. Look at my graphbuilder and my GNNEdgePredictor classes, and look at the trainable components I have. If I produce these richer training signals, what is the guarantee that my current architecture will actually capture those signal effectively, take into account my embedding techniques and the embedding dimensions I have used. I want to know the surety of whether the signals I am producing actually can be effectively mapped using my current architecture. Also tell me if this is something I do not have to worry about if the internal transformations do not matter as much as long as my training signal is explicit about where I want the output to point to.


Keep your answer focused and nuanced like above, you're doing a great job thus far.

## Response:
04/10/2025, 13:35:33

Thought process: Probed downstream table reasoning tasks and architectural signal mapping.

The user is asking two focused questions:

1. Beyond SQL, what other downstream tasks for table reasoning should be considered? They want to capture what an experienced data scientist/analyst would implicitly know.

2. Is their current architecture capable of capturing richer training signals? Looking at the GraphBuilder and GNNEdgePredictor classes, they want to know if the embedding dimensions and techniques can effectively map the new semantic signals.

Let me analyze both carefully.

For question 1, I need to think about what data scientists/analysts actually do with tables beyond SQL:
- Exploratory data analysis patterns
- Feature engineering for ML
- Data quality assessment
- Statistical testing
- Report generation
- Anomaly detection
- Time series analysis

For question 2, I need to examine their architecture:
- LightweightFeatureTokenizer creates 512-dim embeddings (semantic encoder + TF-IDF + metadata features)
- GNNEdgePredictor has 3 GNN layers with hidden_dim=256
- Edge classifier concatenates node embeddings (256*2=512) and classifies into num_classes
- Currently 18 classes, but this can expand

The key question is whether 512-dim embeddings → 256-dim GNN → 18+ class classification can capture richer semantics.


1. Downstream Tasks Beyond SQL


An experienced data scientist's implicit ontologies for table reasoning:


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Patterns


DISTRIBUTION_COMPARISON: Columns to compare for statistical tests

OUTLIER_CONTEXT: Columns that explain anomalies in another column

CORRELATION_CONFOUNDERS: Third variables that explain correlations

SEGMENTATION_KEYS: Natural grouping columns for cohort analysis


Feature Engineering Relationships


INTERACTION_CANDIDATES: Columns whose product/ratio is meaningful

LAG_DEPENDENCIES: Temporal columns for time-series features

ENCODING_TARGETS: Categorical-continuous pairs for target encoding

NORMALIZATION_GROUPS: Columns to normalize within groups


Data Quality & Validation


INTEGRITY_CONSTRAINTS: Columns that must maintain referential integrity

BUSINESS_RULES: Pairs that encode domain constraints (e.g., end_date > start_date)

DUPLICATE_INDICATORS: Column combinations that identify unique records

MISSING_PATTERNS: Columns with correlated missing values


Visualization & Reporting


NATURAL_AXES: Obvious x-y pairs for visualization

DRILL_DOWN_PATHS: Hierarchies for interactive dashboards

SUMMARY_STATISTICS: Measure-dimension pairs for pivot tables


These capture the "mental model" of table relationships that inform exploratory analysis, not just query writing.


2. Architecture Capacity Analysis


Current Bottlenecks:


Your embedding pipeline: 512-dim input → 256-dim GNN hidden → 512-dim edge concat → 18+ classes


The concerning compression:


LightweightFeatureTokenizer produces 512-dim vectors but only ~8 dims are metadata features, rest is semantic encoder output

Semantic encoder (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) embeds the content string, not the relationship features

Your new semantic features (functional dependency, ID patterns, etc.) aren't embedded - they only influence label selection


Critical gap: Your node embeddings capture column content but not relational features. The GNN must learn to reconstruct relationships from content alone.


Why This Might Still Work:


The GNN's 3-hop architecture allows it to:


First layer: Learn column representations that encode relationship potential

Second layer: Aggregate neighborhood patterns

Third layer: Refine based on graph structure


The edge classifier (512-dim input) has sufficient capacity IF the node embeddings contain relationship-relevant information.


The Real Question:


Your training signal (edge labels) is rich, but your input features (node embeddings) don't directly encode the relationship features you compute. The model must learn to infer functional_dependency from column content samples.


Suggested fix: Include relationship features as edge attributes:


# In GraphBuilder._create_supervised_edges()
edge_features = torch.tensor([
    [rel['auxiliary_features']['id_reference'],
     rel['auxiliary_features']['functional_dependency'],
     ...] 
    for rel in relationships
])
data.edge_attr = torch.cat([edge_labels.unsqueeze(1), edge_features], dim=1)


Then modify GNN to use edge features in message passing. This ensures your rich signals actually influence the model beyond just the classification target.


Bottom line: Your architecture can theoretically learn the mappings, but you're making it unnecessarily hard by not feeding relationship features directly into the model. The semantic signals in your labels are only useful if the model can access the features that generated them.

## Prompt:
04/10/2025, 13:46:10

Okay, now I have two followup questions for each of my original questions, remember to not stray from the objective at hand and provide good practical suggestions that can be rapidly implemented.


The first question is, can you pick out the most relevant and impactful ontologies that I should include. Do not pick more than 2 per section, and omit the visualization section for now. Once you have picked them out, present to me: Features I need to calculate for each ontology -> how to construct the classifier for each ontology label -> interpretation for each label. Present the answer to me in the form of a python dict.

Right now, my GNN does not incorporate edges in itself, this is due to the fact that in a real world scenario I want to reduce computations and make predictions by just looking at the columns like an analyst would do, there is little point in calculating all the features again and again, but if these edge features produce signals that can help guide the classification task, then I want you to tell me how I would incorporate these features in my GNN. Begin by telling me how to effectively embed these features, how to concatenate these embeddings so they retain the signal and then how does this change my GNN architecture. For the GNN architecture changes, since my edges also contain information, how I can I now start doing missing link prediction. Remember, I do not want to make the architecture overly complicated and practicality is important. Also, I want to stick to vanilla GNNs unless extremely necessary.


You can go in detail if you think there are understanding gaps, for example, how edge features are incorporated and used in missing link predictions in GNNs, that is something I would want information on.

Thought process: Strategized ontologies and GNN edge feature integration techniques.

The user is asking for two specific things:

1. Pick the most relevant ontologies (2 per section max, excluding visualization), and present them as a Python dict with features, classifier construction, and interpretations.

2. How to incorporate edge features into the GNN architecture for better signal retention and missing link prediction.

Let me address these carefully and practically.

For 1, I need to select the most impactful ontologies:
- SQL: PRIMARY_FOREIGN_KEY, MEASURE_DIMENSION (most common SQL patterns)
- EDA: SEGMENTATION_KEYS, OUTLIER_CONTEXT (core analytical patterns)
- Feature Engineering: INTERACTION_CANDIDATES, ENCODING_TARGETS (direct ML impact)
- Data Quality: DUPLICATE_INDICATORS, INTEGRITY_CONSTRAINTS (fundamental data issues)

For 2, I need to explain how edge features work in GNNs and provide practical implementation without overcomplicating.

2. Incorporating Edge Features in GNN


Edge Feature Embedding Strategy


class EdgeFeatureEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_edge_features, edge_embed_dim=64):
        super().__init__()
        # Simple MLP to embed continuous edge features
        self.edge_encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(num_edge_features, edge_embed_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(edge_embed_dim, edge_embed_dim)
        )
    
    def forward(self, edge_features):
        return self.edge_encoder(edge_features)


Modified GNN Architecture with Edge Features


In GNN message passing, edge features influence how information flows between nodes. Here's how to modify your architecture:


class EdgeAwareGCNLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, node_dim, edge_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        # Compute message using both node and edge features
        self.message_mlp = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(node_dim * 2 + edge_dim, output_dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(output_dim, output_dim)
        )
        
    def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_features):
        # x: [num_nodes, node_dim]
        # edge_features: [num_edges, edge_dim]
        
        src, dst = edge_index
        src_features = x[src]  # [num_edges, node_dim]
        dst_features = x[dst]  # [num_edges, node_dim]
        
        # Concatenate source, dest, and edge features
        messages = torch.cat([src_features, dst_features, edge_features], dim=1)
        messages = self.message_mlp(messages)
        
        # Aggregate messages (mean pooling)
        output = torch.zeros_like(x)
        output.index_add_(0, dst, messages)
        
        return output


Missing Link Prediction with Edge Features


For missing link prediction, you predict whether an edge should exist AND its label:


class EnhancedGNNEdgePredictor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, node_dim, num_edge_features, hidden_dim=256, num_classes=18):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Edge feature encoder
        self.edge_encoder = EdgeFeatureEncoder(num_edge_features, edge_embed_dim=64)
        
        # Modified GNN layers
        self.gnn_layers = nn.ModuleList([
            EdgeAwareGCNLayer(node_dim if i==0 else hidden_dim, 
                            64,  # edge_embed_dim
                            hidden_dim)
            for i in range(3)
        ])
        
        # Two heads: existence prediction + label classification
        self.existence_head = nn.Linear(hidden_dim * 2 + 64, 1)  # Binary: edge exists?
        self.label_head = nn.Linear(hidden_dim * 2 + 64, num_classes)  # Which type?
        
    def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_features, candidate_pairs=None):
        # Encode edge features
        edge_embeds = self.edge_encoder(edge_features)
        
        # GNN forward pass
        for layer in self.gnn_layers:
            x = layer(x, edge_index, edge_embeds)
        
        # For missing link prediction on candidate pairs
        if candidate_pairs is not None:
            src, dst = candidate_pairs
            src_embeds = x[src]
            dst_embeds = x[dst]
            
            # For candidate pairs, compute edge features on-the-fly
            candidate_edge_features = self.compute_edge_features(src, dst)
            candidate_edge_embeds = self.edge_encoder(candidate_edge_features)
            
            combined = torch.cat([src_embeds, dst_embeds, candidate_edge_embeds], dim=1)
            
            existence_logits = self.existence_head(combined)
            label_logits = self.label_head(combined)
            
            return existence_logits, label_logits


Key Insights on Edge Features in GNNs:


Edge features as message modulators: They control how information flows between nodes, making some connections "stronger" for information propagation

Missing link prediction: You predict edges that don't exist in training but should semantically exist. This requires computing edge features for non-existing edges at inference time

Practical consideration: Store precomputed edge features during training but compute them on-the-fly for candidate edges during inference


The architecture remains vanilla GCN-like but now incorporates edge information directly into message passing, making the learned representations more aware of the relationship types you're trying to predict.
