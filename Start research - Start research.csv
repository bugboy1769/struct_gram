Label Key,Interpretation
HIGH_COS_LOW_JAC_NUM,"Label: LINEAR_NUMERICAL_DEPENDENCE This is the most powerful signal of a direct, predictable numerical relationship. The high cosine similarity indicates a strong proportional relationship, suggesting that the two columns track together linearly. The low Jaccard index confirms that these columns are not drawing from a small, shared set of unique values, which is typical of continuous or high-cardinality numerical data. This combination is a classic signature for direct computations, such as Total_Bill being the product of unit_price and transaction_qty, or for strong correlations between two independent numerical measures like temperature and sales. The model trained on this label learns to identify a ""computational relationship"" without being explicitly taught the formula, thereby demonstrating a high degree of interpretative power."
LOW_COS_HIGH_JAC_CAT,"Label: CATEGORICAL_DERIVATION_OR_ALIAS This label signifies that two columns are conceptually or functionally the same, sharing a nearly identical set of unique values. The low cosine value is expected for categorical data, as the directional relationship of a vector is less meaningful for non-numerical values. The high Jaccard index, however, is a strong signal of a shared vocabulary. This often means one column is an alias or a direct derivation of another, such as Day Name being derived from Day of Week or a product_category (Tea) and product_type (Brewed herbal tea) having a one-to-one relationship in a subset of the data. This label is crucial for teaching the GNN to recognize redundant or aliased information across tables, which is invaluable for tasks like schema matching and data cleaning."
LOW_COS_LOW_JAC_CAT,"Label: WEAK_HETEROGENEOUS_RELATIONSHIP This is the baseline label for columns that have no discernible relationship. The low scores on both metrics, along with different data types, indicate that these two attributes do not share a common pattern, common values, or a directional relationship. For example, transaction_id and product_category would likely fall into this category. This is a critical negative example for the GNN, as it teaches the model what a non-relationship looks like and helps it avoid making spurious connections. A model that can correctly identify these non-relationships is just as valuable as one that identifies strong relationships."
MED_COS_LOW_JAC_NUM,"Label: MODERATE_NUMERICAL_CORRELATION This label describes a relationship between two numerical columns that is present but not strongly linear. The moderate cosine similarity suggests a general trend, but the vectors are not perfectly aligned, indicating the presence of noise, confounding variables, or a weak underlying connection. The low Jaccard score confirms the high cardinality of the numerical data. The GNN trained on this label learns to differentiate a subtle, noisy relationship from a strong, deterministic one. This is particularly useful for identifying exploratory data points that may warrant further analysis but do not represent a direct causal link."
LOW_COS_MED_JAC_CAT,"Label: PARTIAL_CATEGORICAL_OVERLAP This label represents a moderate overlap in the unique values of two categorical columns. The columns are not aliases but share a common subset of values. This often indicates a relationship where one column's values are a subset of the other's, or a scenario where two independent columns draw from a partial common vocabulary. For example, if a product_category and a product_type table share some common terms, but the relationship is not one-to-one. Training the GNN to recognize this teaches it to identify complex, many-to-many relationships within the data schema."
HIGH_COS_HIGH_JAC_CAT,"Label: IDENTICAL_OR_REDUNDANT This label signals that two categorical columns are essentially identical. The high Jaccard score implies a near-perfect overlap in unique values, and the high cosine score (if applicable to the data representation) reinforces this. This could indicate a scenario where two columns, such as Month and Month Name, have a one-to-one mapping in the entire dataset. A model that can recognize this identifies truly redundant information, which is a valuable step in data lineage and schema optimization."
MED_COS_HIGH_JAC_NUM,"Label: NUMERICAL_ALIAS_WITH_NOISE This label describes a situation where two numerical columns are conceptually the same or one is a noisy alias of another. The high Jaccard index implies that the unique values are highly overlapping, suggesting the columns are drawing from a small, discrete set. The medium cosine score indicates that while the columns are directionally related, there is significant noise or minor deviations. This can be a sign of data entry errors, rounding, or an intentional, but slightly imperfect, redundancy."
HIGH_COS_MED_JAC_NUM,"Label: COMPUTATIONAL_DEPENDENCE_WITH_SHARED_VALUES This label suggests a strong linear relationship between two numerical columns that also share a moderate number of unique values. This could occur in a time-series dataset where two columns, such as Hour and Day of Week (when represented numerically), show a consistent linear trend but also draw from a limited number of discrete values. The high cosine indicates the linear component, while the medium Jaccard highlights the limited, shared vocabulary."
